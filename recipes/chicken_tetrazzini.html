    <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
    <p>*To cook your own chicken: in your dutch oven or pot, melt 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp 
        oil over medium-high heat. Season 2 lbs chicken breasts with about 1/2 tsp salt 
        and 1/4 tsp pepper. Once oil is hot, saute chicken until golden brown on both 
        sides and cooked through (about 4 min per side). Remove to cutting board to cool 
        then cut into bite-sized pieces.</p>
    <p>**If baking in a 13x9 casserole dish, cover with foil and bake 25-30 minutes then 
        bake uncovered an additional 10-15 min (it bakes 5-10 min faster in a casserole dish).</p>
