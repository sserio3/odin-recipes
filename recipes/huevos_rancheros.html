        <li>1/4 cup water</li>

        <li>1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) of your favorite red salsa, either homemade or jarred</li>
        <li>4 tsp extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>4 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Optional garnishes: Crumbled Cotija or feta cheese, sliced avocado, additional 
            chopped cilantro and/or hot sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the pico de gallo: In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, 
            cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Stir to combine, then set the bowl aside for 
            later.</li>
        <li>To cook the beans: In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil 
            until shimmering. Add the onions and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until 
            the onions have softened and are turning translucent, about 3 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the cumin and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
            Pour in the drained beans and water. Stir, cover and cook for 5 minutes. 
            Reduce the heat to low, then remove the lid and use a potato masher or the 
            back of a fork to mash up about at least half of the beans. Continue to cook 
            the beans, uncovered, stirring often, for 2 to 3 more minutes, until thickened.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the pepper and lime juice. Taste and 
            add more salt, pepper or lime juice if necessary. If the beans seem dry, add a 
            very small splash of water and stir to combine. Cover until you're ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm the salsa. Pour the salsa into a medium saucepan over medium 
            heat. Bring the salsa to a simmer, stirring occasionally, and then reduce the 
            heat to low until you're ready to serve. (Or, warm the salsa in a bowl in the 
            microwaveâ€”it won't condense as much but it'll work!)</li>
        <li>In a small skillet over medium heat, warm each tortilla individually, flipping 
            as necessary. Spread the black bean mixture over each tortilla and place each 
            tortilla on an individual plate. If using Jack cheese, sprinkle it over the 
            tortillas. Set aside.</li>
        <li>To fry the eggs: In the same skillet over medium heat, pour in 1 teaspoon 
            olive oil and wait until it's shimmering. Carefully crack an egg and pour 
            it into the skillet without breaking the yolk. Fry the egg, lifting and 
            tilting the pan occasionally to redistribute the oil, until the whites are 
            set and the yolk is cooked to your preferred level of doneness. Place the 
            fried egg on top of a prepared tortilla and repeat with the remaining eggs.</li>
        <li>Spoon about one-fourth of the warmed salsa across each dish, avoiding the egg 
            yolk. Use a slotted spoon or fork to do the same with the pico de gallo, 
            leaving the messy tomato juices behind. Sprinkle with freshly ground black 
            pepper and add any additional garnishes you might like.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately. If you don't use up all of your beans, leftovers are a 
            great dip for tortilla chips.</li>
